Framework: SwiftCollab Advanced Statistical Testing Suite

=== STATISTICAL A/B TEST REPORT ===
Test Date: 2025-07-20 03:33:42
Test Type: Sequential Welch's t-test with early stopping

ALGORITHMS COMPARED:
  Algorithm A: Bubble Sort
  Algorithm B: Quick Sort

SAMPLE STATISTICS:
  Algorithm A: n=40, mean=0.942ms, sd=0.284ms
  Algorithm B: n=40, mean=0.107ms, sd=0.027ms

HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
  H₀: μA = μB (no difference between algorithms)
  H₁: μA ≠ μB (significant difference exists)
  α = 0.050 (95.0% confidence level)
  t-statistic = 18.5057
  degrees of freedom = 39.7
  p-value = 0.000000
  Result: REJECT H₀

EFFECT SIZE ANALYSIS:
  Cohen's d = 4.138 (Large effect)
  Performance Change: 776.7% (Algorithm B faster)
  95.0% CI: [0.746, 0.923]

STATISTICAL POWER:
  Power = 1.000
  Minimum Required Sample Size: 1

WARNINGS:
  ⚠️  Normality assumptions may be violated. Consider Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric analysis

RECOMMENDATION:
  Statistically significant difference detected (p=0.000000 < α=0.050). Recommend using Quick Sort with large effect practical significance (776.7% improvement).

BUSINESS IMPACT:
  HIGH IMPACT: 776.7% performance improvement could significantly reduce operational costs and improve user experience.
