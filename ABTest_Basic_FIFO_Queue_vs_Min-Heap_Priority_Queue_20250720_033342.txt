Framework: SwiftCollab Advanced Statistical Testing Suite

=== STATISTICAL A/B TEST REPORT ===
Test Date: 2025-07-20 03:33:42
Test Type: Welch's t-test (unequal variances)

ALGORITHMS COMPARED:
  Algorithm A: Basic FIFO Queue
  Algorithm B: Min-Heap Priority Queue

SAMPLE STATISTICS:
  Algorithm A: n=20, mean=620.900ms, sd=123.574ms
  Algorithm B: n=20, mean=631.688ms, sd=118.787ms

HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
  H₀: μA = μB (no difference between algorithms)
  H₁: μA ≠ μB (significant difference exists)
  α = 0.050 (95.0% confidence level)
  t-statistic = -0.2815
  degrees of freedom = 37.9
  p-value = 0.778353
  Result: FAIL TO REJECT H₀

EFFECT SIZE ANALYSIS:
  Cohen's d = 0.089 (Negligible effect)
  Performance Change: 1.7% (Algorithm A faster)
  95.0% CI: [-85.910, 64.334]

STATISTICAL POWER:
  Power = 0.059
  Minimum Required Sample Size: 1982

WARNINGS:
  ⚠️  Low statistical power (0.059). Consider increasing sample size to 1982+
  ⚠️  Small sample sizes may affect reliability. Central Limit Theorem is more reliable with n≥30

RECOMMENDATION:
  No statistically significant difference detected (p=0.778353 ≥ α=0.050). Consider collecting more data or the algorithms perform similarly.

BUSINESS IMPACT:
  No significant business impact expected from algorithm change.
