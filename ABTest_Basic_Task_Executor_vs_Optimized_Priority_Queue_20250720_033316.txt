=== STATISTICAL A/B TEST REPORT ===
Test Date: 2025-07-20 03:33:16
Test Type: Welch's t-test (unequal variances)

ALGORITHMS COMPARED:
  Algorithm A: Basic Task Executor
  Algorithm B: Optimized Priority Queue

SAMPLE STATISTICS:
  Algorithm A: n=30, mean=349.645ms, sd=26.956ms
  Algorithm B: n=30, mean=305.201ms, sd=50.950ms

HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
  H₀: μA = μB (no difference between algorithms)
  H₁: μA ≠ μB (significant difference exists)
  α = 0.050 (95.0% confidence level)
  t-statistic = 4.2232
  degrees of freedom = 44.1
  p-value = 0.000024
  Result: REJECT H₀

EFFECT SIZE ANALYSIS:
  Cohen's d = 1.090 (Large effect)
  Performance Change: 14.6% (Algorithm B faster)
  95.0% CI: [23.818, 65.070]

STATISTICAL POWER:
  Power = 0.988
  Minimum Required Sample Size: 14

RECOMMENDATION:
  Statistically significant difference detected (p=0.000024 < α=0.050). Recommend using Optimized Priority Queue with large effect practical significance (14.6% improvement).

BUSINESS IMPACT:
  LOW IMPACT: 14.6% performance improvement provides marginal business value.
