=== SwiftCollab Task Assignment System Optimization ===
1. Performance Comparison:
Original vs Optimized Binary Tree for Task Priority Management

Original Tree Insert Time: 1384 ticks
Optimized Tree Insert Time: 6687 ticks

Original Tree Height: Approximately 10 (unbalanced)
Optimized Tree Height: 4 (balanced)
Tree is balanced: True
Total tasks stored: 10

2. New Functionality for SwiftCollab:
Adding tasks with priorities: 50, 30, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80, 10, 25, 35

--- Task Management Operations ---
Searching for task priority 35: True
Searching for task priority 100: False
Highest priority task: 80
Lowest priority task: 10
All tasks in priority order: 10 20 25 30 35 40 50 60 70 80 
Tasks with priority 30-60: 30 35 40 50 60 

Completing task with priority 50...
Remaining tasks: 10 20 25 30 35 40 60 70 80 
Tree remains balanced after deletion: True
Remaining task count: 9

=== Optimization Summary ===
✓ Self-balancing AVL tree ensures O(log n) operations
✓ Fast task search and retrieval
✓ Efficient task completion handling
✓ Range queries for filtering tasks by priority
✓ Performance monitoring capabilities
✓ Scalable design for growing task volumes

=== Running Binary Tree Optimization Tests ===

1. Testing AVL Balancing:
   Inserted 15 sequential values
   Tree height: 4 (should be ~4 for balanced)
   Is balanced: True
   Node count: 15
   ✅ AVL balancing working correctly

2. Testing Search Functionality:
   Search for existing value (35): True
   Search for non-existing value (100): False
   ✅ Search functionality working correctly

3. Testing Delete Operations:
   Nodes before deletion: 7
   Nodes after deletion: 6
   Tree still balanced: True
   ✅ Delete operations working correctly

4. Testing Edge Cases:
   ✅ Empty tree exception handling correct
   Single node min: 42
   Single node max: 42
   ✅ Single node operations working correctly

5. Testing Performance Monitoring:
   Tree height: 4
   Node count: 11
   Is balanced: True
   Range 20-50: Tasks with priority 20-50: 25 31 37 43 50 
   ✅ Performance monitoring working correctly

✅ All tests completed successfully!
