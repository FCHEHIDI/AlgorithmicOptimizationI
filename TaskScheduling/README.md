# Task Scheduling Algorithm Optimization

## 📋 Problem Statement

SwiftCollab's task scheduling system needs optimization to handle the growing complexity of workflow automation and team coordination. The current scheduling algorithm shows performance bottlenecks that need LLM-assisted analysis and improvement.

## 🎯 Optimization Goals

### **Areas for Investigation:**
- [ ] Analyze current scheduling algorithm performance
- [ ] Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies 
- [ ] Implement LLM-recommended optimizations
- [ ] Create comprehensive testing suite
- [ ] Measure and document performance improvements

### **Expected Improvements:**
- Faster task assignment and scheduling
- Better resource utilization
- Improved workflow automation
- Scalable design for growing teams

## 🚧 Status: Ready for Development

This optimization will follow the same LLM-assisted methodology used for the successful binary tree optimization, ensuring consistent quality and documentation standards.

## 📁 Planned Files:
- `SchedulingAlgorithm.cs` - Original implementation
- `OptimizedScheduler.cs` - LLM-optimized version
- `SchedulingTests.cs` - Comprehensive test suite
- Performance reports and documentation
