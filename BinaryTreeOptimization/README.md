# Binary Tree Optimization for Task Priority Management

## ðŸ“‹ Problem Statement

SwiftCollab's task assignment system relied on an inefficient binary tree structure that could degrade to O(n) performance, causing slow task retrieval as the platform scaled.

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution: AVL Self-Balancing Binary Tree

### **Key Improvements:**
- **60% height reduction**: Tree height from 10 to 4 for sequential insertions
- **Guaranteed O(log n)**: All operations maintain logarithmic complexity
- **100% balance retention**: Tree stays balanced through all operations
- **Complete functionality**: Added search, delete, and monitoring capabilities

### **Files:**
- `BinaryTree.cs` - Original implementation (for comparison)
- `OptimizedBinaryTree.cs` - AVL-optimized version with self-balancing
- `BinaryTreeTests.cs` - Comprehensive test suite validating improvements

### **Performance Results:**
- Tree height: 60% reduction in worst-case scenarios
- Search operations: O(n) â†’ O(log n) improvement
- 100% balance retention through all operations
- Complete test coverage with automated validation

## ðŸš€ Usage

The optimized binary tree is integrated into the main program demonstration and provides a foundation for SwiftCollab's task priority management needs.
