ðŸ“Š SWIFTCOLLAB STATISTICAL VALIDATION REPORT
=============================================================
Generated: 2025-07-20 03:33:42

ðŸŽ¯ STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY:
  â€¢ Welch's t-test for parametric comparisons
  â€¢ Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric data
  â€¢ One-way ANOVA for multiple algorithm comparison
  â€¢ Sequential testing with early stopping
  â€¢ Effect size analysis (Cohen's d)
  â€¢ Statistical power analysis
  â€¢ Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons

ðŸ“ˆ KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS:
  â€¢ Execution time reduction (primary metric)
  â€¢ Statistical significance (p-value < Î±)
  â€¢ Effect size magnitude (Cohen's d)
  â€¢ Confidence intervals for improvements
  â€¢ Statistical power (Î² â‰¥ 0.80)

ðŸ”¬ VALIDATION DOMAINS:
  âœ… Sorting Algorithms: O(nÂ²) â†’ O(n log n) validation
  âœ… Task Scheduling: Priority queue optimization
